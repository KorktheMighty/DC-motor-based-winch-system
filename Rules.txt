The controller must satisfy the following requirements:

1.	At a rate of 20 times a second, the controller must read the input signal from the joystick and send the appropriate speed and direction output signals to the motor.

2.	The speed output signal to the motor must be at a frequency less than 10 kHz.

3.	At a rate of 10 times a second, the controller must update a display with the value of the output signals (speed and direction) that are being sent to the motor.

4.	At a rate of 5 times a second, the controller must update a display with the current 16-bit value of the shaft encoder attached to the motor.

5.	At a rate of 2 times a second, the controller must compute and update a display with the current speed of the motor in RPM (xx.x) and the direction in which the motor is rotating (cw or ccw).

6.	At a rate of 1 time a second, the controller must toggle an LED to indicate that the controller is operating.

Display for the LCD screen:


c	n	t	:		x	x	x	x		d	:		x	x	x
s	p	:		d	d	.	d		r	p	m		s	s	s


cnt: is the sa_counter in HEX

d: is the delta_counter in HEX

sp: is the RPM in floating point representation using integer math (and rpm is its units)

sss will be the cw or ccw that denotes motor direction in clockwise or counter-clockwise.
